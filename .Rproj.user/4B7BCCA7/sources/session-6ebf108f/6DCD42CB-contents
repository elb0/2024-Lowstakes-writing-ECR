THINK/PAIR/SHARE is also an example of a useful classrom structure to
use, with or without associated writing

## why write?

::: incremental
-   Passive consumption ➡️ active engagement with concepts 💡

-   Communication with others / knowledge translation 💬

-   Processing and organising information (communicating with yourself)
    / critical thinking 🤔

-   Because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ said you have to (lecturer, boss, journal
    publisher, grant authority...etc.) 💼

## what is low-stakes writing?

Low-stakes writing is writing where students do not feel a lot of
pressure about writing --- it is usually 'low stakes' in that it isn't
worth a lot of **marks,** but there are also [**reputational
risks**]{.highlight .bold} that students perceive when others will be
reading their writing.

-   Opportunities for anonymous writing *in class*

    -   Risks of bad behaviour, but these are fairly easy to mitigate
        'live' and also not very common in my experience --- and I've
        taught large first year courses!.

-   Opportunities for writing *in assessments*

    -   To keep marking burden low, consider a fairly simple rubric that
        you can also share with students.
    -   I'd recommend not including these in timed assessments unless
        they are very short and students have had practice.

## additional considerations

-   Writing may be especially daunting for **English Language Learners**
    / students for whom English is an additional language, and students
    who may not have **adequate preparation from high school** / had a
    long gap before university. This shouldn't deter us from encouraging
    writing, and in fact is *exactly why* we should integrate practice
    and provide resources.

-   Not all students will be familiar with common instructions for
    writing. I've encountered this most from
    students who did not do high school in Aotearoa / recently.

    -   Examples include: "compare and contrast", "describe" vs
        "discuss", what it means to interpret something "in context".

## what is academic reflection?

"Academic reflective writing requires critical and analytic thought, a
clear line of argument, and the use of evidence through examples of
personal experiences and thoughts and often also theoretical
literature." from the University of Edinburgh [Reflection
Toolkit](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/producing-reflections/academic-reflections/general-tips).

<br>

"**Critical reflection** is the conscious examination of past
experiences, thoughts and ways of doing things. Its goal is to surface
learning about oneself and a situation, and to bring meaning to it in
order to inform the present and the future. Reflection challenges the
status quo of practice, thoughts and assumptions and may therefore
inform our decisions, actions, attitudes, beliefs and understanding
about ourselves." from the [University of Edinburgh Reflection Toolkit
literature
review](https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/reflection_literature_review.pdf)

# example from my teaching

## context

-   First assignment in a stage 3 statistics paper (STATS 369: Data
    Science Practice)

-   Worth 3 of 20 marks

-   Assignments viewed as learning tasks in preparation for test/exam
    where students should be aiming for 75%+

## prompt

1.  Read over the refreshed [graduate capability themes, LEVEL 2:
    Graduate Capabilities --
    Themes](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/forms-policies-and-guidelines/student-policies-and-guidelines/graduate-profile.html)
    that connects to [Taumata
    Teitei](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/on-campus/life-on-campus/latest-student-news/curriculum-framework-transformation-programme0/university-graduate&~_).
    Choose one specific task or subtask in this assignment or in lab 01
    or lab 02 and discuss how your work demonstrates ONE of these
    specific capabilities. Make sure you explain the capability in your
    own words as well as referencing the graduate profile. Assume your
    audience is the HR team at a potential employer for the Data Science
    job of your dreams. Write \~100 to 300 words. \[2 marks\]

2.  What is something you're proud of in the assignment? \[0.5 marks\]

3.  What is something you're going to do differently for the next
    assignment? \[0.5 marks\]

## considerations for your grading instructions

Marks were given for reasonable effort. It should be clear which task
and which capability students are connecting to in (1).

<br>

#### perfect is the enemy of good

Writing does not need to be perfect for full marks, but should be
readable with minimal challenge. Marks for writing only lost if the
grader cannot understand what is being expressed.

<br>

#### provide some likely examples for the graders

Examples could be their summary for Black Saber in this assessment
connecting to 'Communication', as they are writing a summary for a
non-stats audience, or 'Solution Seeking' --- addressing issues of
gender bias as they "consider multiple perspectives in their
solution-seeking", or 'Ethics and Professionalism' as 'exhibiting
independent thought' is key to auditing a system.

# anna fergusson 😻 

The fantastic **Quick, Write!** app we used today was designed and built by Dr Anna Fergusson.

Read her recent TeachWell profile [*Stats and cats: Herding numbers in large classrooms.*](https://teachwell.auckland.ac.nz/2024/03/28/stats-and-cats-herding-numbers-in-large-classrooms/)

<br>

**Other applications to consider:**

- [PollEverywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/)
- [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)

Last I checked, these both have a 'freemium' model, so you can trial them. Ask in your Department/Centre if there are any subscriptions already available or if they are willing to fund technology-integrated learning.
