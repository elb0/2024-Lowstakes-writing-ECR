## warm-up question

::: callout-note
**How do you think students view writing in your discipline?**
:::

### THINK. \[30 secs\]

Consider your answer to this question.

### PAIR. \[2 mins\]

Talk to the person next you about

-   What discipline do you/will you teach in?

*Insert the QR code (can reuse from Data Aotearoa)*

# Why write?

::: incremental
-   Communication with others

-   Processing and organising information (communicating with yourself)

-   Because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ said you have to (lecturer, boss, journal
    publisher, grant authority...etc.)
:::

# What is low stakes writing?

Low stakes writing is writing where students do not need to feel a lot
of pressure about writing --- it is usually 'low stakes' in that it
isn't worth a lot of **marks,** but there are also **reputational
risks** that students perceive when others will be reading their
writing.

-   Opportunities for anonymous writing in class

    -   Risks of bad behaviour, but these are fairly easy to mitigate
        'live' and also not very common in my experience --- and I've
        taught large first year courses!

-   Opportunities for writing in assessments
